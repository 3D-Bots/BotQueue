<p>Hah, just kidding!  Writing documentation at this stage takes time from writing code.  Still, here's some help for ya.</p>

<p>The API uses OAuth for authentication of client requests.  You'll want to tackle that first if you're not using the python client.</p>

<p>The API is still under development, and may be a moving target for a while.  It is functional, but your best shot at documentation is to look at the <a href="https://github.com/Hoektronics/BotQueue/blob/master/controllers/apiv1.php">API controller</a> for the server, as well as the <a href="https://github.com/Hoektronics/BotQueue/blob/master/bumblebee/botqueueapi.py">python client implementation</a>.</p>

<p>If you want to pitch in, or you spot a bug, please get ahold of me.  I'd love to get some extra eyes on the code, and I really hope to turn this into world-class software.</p>
